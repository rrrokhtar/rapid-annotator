# Introduction
Red Hen’s Rapid Annotator provides a platform to users to annotate large chunks of data in a short span of time and with least possible efforts. It provides the features of annotating images/videos/audios/text during collaborative situation also. With Red Hen Lab’s we will try to enable users to visualize the progress of each annotator separately and annotators can notify experimenter when the annotation is finished to make the annotation work more efficient.  
In Red Hen Lab’s Rapid Annotator we try to enable researchers worldwide to annotate large chunks of data in a very short period of time with least effort possible and try to get started with minimal training. 
I have been continuing working on Red Hen Lab's Rapid Annotator after work done by Gulshan Kumar and Vaibhav Gubta at GSoC's 20, 19 and 18.

4.  [Elan experiment type #66](https://github.com/RedHenLab/RapidAnnotator-2.0/pull/66)
    <details>           
    
    ### Description
    Elan experiment: is a new category of experiments (extension to video experiment) that is needed to be added to rapid annotator that allows multiple and infinite count of annotations for each level.
    New analogies (for elan experiment):
    - Level: Tier
    - Label: (Annotation) Text

    The structure of each annotation entry will be as the following (description of database changes): 
    _Note: Database schema updated image is added in docs folder_
    ElanAnnotation: 
    - id - Int (auto increment)
    - experimentId - the experiment is being in the process
    - fileId - the file is being annotated
    - data - json ; that is the point to be explained 

    Review of what is the replacement: each selected label was recorded as a single record in AnnotationInfo table.
    For elan it is instead of keeping a single record for each entry (as they are infinite; not limited to the count of labels inside each level) it was better to use a json type
    So far, **data** is a json type contains the following: 
    ``` json
    {
    "levelId01": [{"startTime": 0.01, "endTime": 0.036, "text": "Anythingcan be here"}]
    }
    ```
    It is an object contains (levels/tiers ids of the experiment as keys and for each tierId it contains an array which is the content of annotations) 
    Sample view explained 
    ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/39674365/193066232-472bdc0c-ac6b-480d-9a7a-618aea9b8278.png)
    that image is represneted as the following:
    ```json
    {
      "34": [
        {
          "text": "label 1",
          "endTime": 6.5,
          "startTime": 0
        },
        {
          "text": "label 3",
          "endTime": 19.25,
          "startTime": 10.0625
        }
      ],
      "35": [
        {
          "text": "dsa",
          "endTime": 15,
          "startTime": 2.4375
        }
      ]
    ```
    -------------------------------------

    Results is exported in 2 ways

    1. All results of the experiment at once in a tabular format contains the following columns (['File Name', 'Annotator', 'Tier Name', 'Annotation Text', 'Start Time (sec)', 'End Time (sec)']) as (csv, xlsx)
    2. Export a .eaf (elan file format) of a specific user's annotation for a specific file 

    ### User interface changes:
    - When creating a new experiment, you will find a new type 
    ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/39674365/193068032-1222c0b9-b521-4656-8b11-20095947274b.png)
    -------------------------------------

    - At view results page you will find a new column that allows you to download a .eaf file for each annotation of the selected user and clicked file

    ### Complete demo (video) for annotation to export results!

    - on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2scBxik5tg&t=1s)

    - The annotation tiers became accessible through numbers as shortcut keys (i.e., first tier can be selected be pressing '1' and second through '2' and etc.). 

    ![tiershortcut](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/39674365/194719059-e0c57975-3231-4361-9895-e361c42ac9b2.gif)

    - Exporting results of grouped annotators of an elan file has been added also.

5.  [Elan labels shortcut keys added and fixed an issue #67](https://github.com/RedHenLab/RapidAnnotator-2.0/pull/67)
    <details>   
    
    - Added the shortcut key of each label below the label 
    ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/39674365/195460799-4330b5fa-e812-45db-9542-37631995ac48.png)

    - Fixed the labels' data-list after adding the numbers shortcut keys for the tiers' selection (the labels options were not being changed)

6.  [Enable/Disable advanced options in the experiment and fixed specific view #68](https://github.com/RedHenLab/RapidAnnotator-2.0/pull/68)
    <details>           
    
    That PR contains two main additions 
    - A new configuration to the experiment to control whether you want to add the new features those added last year in that PR #60 
    so, at the adding new experiment we get a new field for the experiment's table called *advanced annotation* and at the creation of the experiment it appears as a checkbox.

    - At viewing a specific entry of the experiment files (the advanced features above were missing from that view, so they have been added and are being loaded and edited also from specific annotation view) 
    (Example of before and after at an image category experiment)

# Challenges
      
- The most challanging part was my availability schedule which is solved by GSOC's extension of the timeline (accepted by the mentors; I would like to say thanks)
- The ([ELAN](https://archive.mpi.nl/tla/elan) software simple version) software is supposed to be mimicked in the Rapid Annotator to contain a video timeline and tracks annotation was the hardest part in the project; it is done and reached a good state by the helping of mentors and open-source community as well was a part of the solution because I found an inital state that I can start from instead of starting from scratch and lose time that can be used in a more useful way
      
------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Conclusion
- Experiment configuration whether you want to allow the text-field for each selected text box or not through the annotation level settings from the experiment's labels page is added
- Sharing experiment's annotation levels to certain users feature
- Allowing the experiments' owners to import their annotation levels without doing the over-head step [make it global, import it then make it private again]
- ELAN experiment type to the RapidAnnotator is added as a new experiment category ([ELAN](https://archive.mpi.nl/tla/elan) software simple version)
- Ability to use the exported results of elan experiment from rapid annotator to elan software (compatible elan file format)        
- Enable/Disable advanced options in the experiment and fixed specific view A new configuration to the experiment to control whether you want to add the new features those added last year in that PR Annotations adds-on (coordinates feature) #60 so, at the adding new experiment we get a new field for the experiment's table called advanced annotation and at the creation of the experiment it appears as a checkbox.
- At viewing a specific entry of the experiment files (the advanced features above were missing from that view, so they have been added and are being loaded and edited also from specific annotation view)
